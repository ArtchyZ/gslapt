1.  I have a problem or a suggestion for gslapt, where do I take it?

  Please subscribe to slapt-get-devel@software.jaos.org:

2.  Why do I get permission denied on /var/slapt-get ?

  If gslapt doesn't start from the panel or you get a message like:

  /var/slapt-get: Permission denied
  Please update permissions on /var/slapt-get or run with appropriate privileges

  then you are trying to run gslapt as a non root user.  At the moment, there
  are no guaranteed to be present solutions such as gnomesu, gtksu, etc.  You
  can modify the /usr/share/applications/gslapt.desktop file to call one of
  these utilities, if present, before the call to gslapt.  Otherwise you need
  to run gslapt from the command line with sudo or as root (if as root, make
  sure root has access to your current X session).
