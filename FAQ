1.  I have a problem or a suggestion for gslapt, where do I take it?

  If gslapt doesn't start from the panel or you get a message like:
  Email bug reports to me: Jason Woodward <woodwardj at jaos dot org>

  Or file a github issue: https://github.com/jaos/gslapt/issues

2.  Why do I get permission denied on /var/slapt-get ?

  If gslapt doesn't start from the panel or you get a message like:

  /var/slapt-get: Permission denied
  Please update permissions on /var/slapt-get or run with appropriate privileges

  then you are trying to run gslapt as a non root user.  At the moment, the
  install script for the slackware packages attempts to detect utilities such
  as gnomesu, gtksudo, gksu, or kdesu.  You can modify the
  /usr/share/applications/gslapt.desktop file to call one of these utilities,
  if present, before the call to gslapt.
