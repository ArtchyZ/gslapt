1.  I have a problem or a suggestion for gslapt, where do I take it?

  Please subscribe to slapt-get-devel@software.jaos.org:

2.  Why do I get permission denied on /var/slapt-get ?

  If gslapt doesn't start from the panel or you get a message like:

  /var/slapt-get: Permission denied
  Please update permissions on /var/slapt-get or run with appropriate privileges

  then you are trying to run gslapt as a non root user.  At the moment, there
  are no guaranteed solutions such as gnomesu, gtksu, etc.  The user can modify
  the /usr/share/applications/gslapt.desktop file to call one of these before
  gslapt if present.  Otherwise you need to run it from the command line with
  sudo or as root with access to your current X session.
