Things to do:

 * find a way to kill current thread if closing the download progress window
 * bug testing
 * Need to look into generating omf documentation for comprehensive help
   (but does that require gnome libs?)
 * more statusbar usage to notify what we are doing
 * ui cleanups, improvements
 * move to libglade instead of generated code
 * context menu for right click on package in list
 * need to figure out how to find out if gnome-sudo|gksu|etc are installed and use them for the .desktop entry
