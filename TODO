Things to do:

 * figure out how to set and store proxy information
   (write to slapt-getrc or where?)
 * bug testing
 * Need to look into generating omf documentation for comprehensive help
   (but does that require gnome libs?)
 * more statusbar usage to notify what we are doing
 * ui cleanups, improvements
 * move to libglade instead of generated code
